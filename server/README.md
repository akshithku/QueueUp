# QueueUp - Queue Management Website 

QueueUp is a comprehensive queue management website that allows users to view the current token number of doctors and book appointments with them using a simple payment gateway method. The website is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.

# Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced world, managing queues and appointments at healthcare facilities can be a challenging task. Long waiting times, confusion, and lack of transparency can lead to frustration for both patients and healthcare providers. There is a need for an efficient and user-friendly solution that simplifies the queue management process and improves overall patient satisfaction.

# Solution
QueueUp aims to address the challenges of queue management by providing an intuitive web-based platform. The key features of the QueueUp website include:

Current Token Number: Users can easily view the current token number of doctors, allowing them to estimate waiting times and plan their visit accordingly.

Appointment Booking: Users can book appointments with their preferred doctors using a simple and secure payment gateway. This feature ensures convenience and eliminates the need for physical queueing.

Transaction ID Submission: After making a successful payment, users are required to submit the transaction ID through a provided form. This step ensures proper record-keeping and verification of appointments.

User-Facing Interface: The website offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to navigate through the available doctors, select a suitable time slot, and proceed with the appointment booking process seamlessly.

Database Integration: The MERN stack enables seamless integration with MongoDB, providing a reliable and scalable database solution for storing appointment details, user information, and transaction records.

RESTful APIs: The backend of the QueueUp website is built using Node.js and Express.js, allowing the development of robust and efficient RESTful APIs. These APIs facilitate data retrieval, appointment scheduling, and transaction management.

Security and Privacy: The website implements industry-standard security measures to ensure the confidentiality of user information and secure payment transactions.
